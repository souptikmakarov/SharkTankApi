Pulse system had brought in this tender case last week but could not upload the tender bid as he had not received MAF on time from the internal team. Last time also our Partner M/s. Key Computers was willing to bid here but again at the 11th hour it was found that the account team is supporting multiple partnersfrom other regions also for this account.If the partners understand that Dell is supporting multiple partners for the same account then they lose interest in such cases. Thus I would request the concerned Account ISR to ask for the support right when the case is initiated and closely work with one partner for such cases as it makes no sense for us or the partner once the tender date is gone. Also need to understand from the Account ISR that what was the follow up done by them when in the first call itself our partner has participated in this tender and there was no action from the Customer on it.

This model provided dedicated, end-to-end order management support for a select group of our Top Tier Commercial customers in India as partof our new Go To Market structure. This allowed us to create a differentiated and valued experience for these accounts and enabled the account teams to spend more time developing relationships with customers, listening and understanding their desired businessoutcomes and selling solutions across our world-class portfolio.What is OMS Differentiated Support?This diagram shows the key difference between supported and non-supported account teams.

The pilot delivered a HUGE win for our Sales teams, giving around 45 minutes per day back to the pilot ISRs! This win proved the need for more.  We are pleased to announce that effective from 6th August we are expanding the OMS DifferentiatedSupport model into all of the Tier 1 Rep account sets in India! Now almost all of our top Commercial customers in India will receive that differentiated level of support. Note: A \u201cTier 1 Rep\u201d is an ISR whose account set generates not less than 75% of its revenue from Tier 1 accounts.Calls to ActionAttend meetings with Regional OMS case management leaders tounderstand the process and receive information about your dedicated OMS CM.Use the OMS Differentiated Supportprocess for your accounts.Engage your dedicated OMS CM.Engaging Your OMS case ManagerFor OMS Case Manager engagement, click here to reach the intake page.

I believe there\u2019s a major disconnect in the figures that you have quoted as not found on Ariba.Invoices that are in dispute / amendment and rejected are also reflecting under this category. Kindly note that until we have the reasons for the rejections, we would not be able to resolve the issue. I have the data available from Manoj for the recent transactions only.I\u2019ll work on this sheet and map my detailed comments against each of the invoice and discuss with you when we meet tomorrow.Dear Atherv, As discussed in the last meeting, please share the helpdesk details for us to reach out to them for the rejected invoices.

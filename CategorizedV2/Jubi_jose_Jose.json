Was there an official communication sent to the sales team for this change? Because prior to this if there were orders which were missed by sales team for linkage, we used to get credit manually on the same.I might have missed out the new communication if any Secondly, what about orders under &quot;not carry quota for this account&quot;? These orders are of customers of my territory that was wrongly assigned to other sales reps and naturally my team will not carry a quota for this since the affinity itself is not assigned.However when there was an opportunity in these accounts which were worked by my team and when there is a prior approval from the owner account team as well as geo head to take credit for these orders then why are we not being comped?

For homeless, H1 acct assignment is already lock down. Please submit GDMI request to complete linkage and assignment for H2 to prevent same issue again. Mano also publish homeless report every weekwhich sales team can leverage that to remedy acct issue on time.  To submit GDMI request but not manual adjustment is always the instruction when there is credit issue caused by acct question. It\u2019s applied to net new account.

Refer to badge number 974967. I am okay with all the committee comments except the below two for which we have almost 188K of order credits No manual adjustment on homeless order per policy. Sales rep to raise GDMI request to complete account linkage and assignment- Geo Expansion being a large territory where we can add new accounts, we miss out on some orders downloadedby partner team in different customer code which has not been linked. If all the orders are linked then there would be no homeless orders!Not carry quota for the account- Both Vivriti Capital and Add2Pro are from Chennai and the Chennai reps have worked on the order believing they will be credited for the same by the leaders approval Kindly suggest what is the way forward to get these orders credited to the team? Homeless Orders (132K) \u2013 Should the reps raise GDMI now and link customer codes on which the order has been downloaded?Not Carry Quota for account (56K)\u2013 These are net new customers where the reps worked based on the assurance that they will be credited manually.

So CUs will have to prioritize how much do they order. The entire order is around 1.5 cr for this quarter and we are going to loseinterest income if we do not utilize these. I will check with Mona about the Axis laptops if they need it all together or staggered over next 3-4 months. Same for old machines. These machines have to be written down and we could assess the value and charge to the CU. Need their agreement. Amar,How much % of the purchase price typically the machines are valued after 4 years?
